# tryhackme-soc-analysts-rooms
This repository documents my hands-on learning and practical analysis from TryHackMe SOC Analyst–related rooms, focused on building SOC Analyst L1 (Blue Team) skills.

The goal of this repository is not just room completion, but to demonstrate real SOC workflows, including alert triage, log analysis, incident investigation, and basic reporting.
