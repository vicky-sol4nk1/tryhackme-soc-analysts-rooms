# Room:SOC L1 Alert Reporting
TAsk 1: introduction
During or after alert triage, L1 analysts may be uncertain about how to classify the alert, requiring senior support or information from the system owner. Also, L1 may deal with real cyberattacks and breaches that need immediate attention and remediation actions. This room covers these cases by introducing three new terms: alert reporting, escalation, and communication.
